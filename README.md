# **Benchmarking Image Upscaling using GAN on CPUs and GPUs**

# **GPU Setup**
The GPU code has been written in project_gpu.ipynb. If you're running it locally, you will have to change the system working directory in the first block of code to add the cloned ESRGAN model to the working directory. The weight path file has to be loaded for use here.
